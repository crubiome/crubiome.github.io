abstract = {Data is a critical resource for technologies such
as Large Language Models (LLMs) that are driving significant
economic gains. Due to its importance, many different organiza-
tions are collecting and analyzing as much data as possible to
secure their growth and relevance, leading to non-trivial privacy
risks. Among the areas with potential for increased privacy risks
are voluntary data-sharing events, when individuals willingly
exchange their personal data for some service or item. This often
places them in positions where they have inadequate control over
what data should be exchanged and how it should be used.
To address this power imbalance, we aim to obtain, analyze,
and dissect the many different behaviors and needs of both
parties involved in such negotiations, namely, the data subjects,
i.e., the individuals whose data is being exchanged, and the data
requesters, i.e., those who want to acquire the data. As an initial
step, we are developing a multi-stage user study to better under-
stand the factors that govern the behavior of both data subjects
and requesters while interacting in data exchange negotiations.
In addition, we aim to identify the design elements that both
parties require so that future privacy-enhancing technologies
(PETs) prioritizing privacy negotiation algorithms can be further
developed and deployed in practice},
