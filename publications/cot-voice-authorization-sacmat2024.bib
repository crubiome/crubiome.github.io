abstract = {Smart homes, powered by a plethora of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smart thermostats, lights, and TVs, have gained immense popularity due to their simple voice command control, making them user-friendly for homeowners and their families. However, these voice commands can be potentially misused, especially by unauthorized individuals, like visitors or thieves, who may have not been previously authorized to manipulate security sensitive devices, e.g., smart locks. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Circles of Trust (CoT), rooted in a well-known namesake psychological concept which associates relationships to a specific degree of trust. This concept can be applied to an authorization framework, by linking relationships to an access level, e.g., homeowners and their spouses can be fully-trusted, whereas visitors and children may not. CoT can be further visualized as a multi-layered circle, where the most privileged user, e.g., a homeowner, is placed within the innermost layer, and therefore has access to every single device within a smart home via voice commands. Each subsequent layer has fewer access privileges than the previous, granting users in outer layers, like visitors, limited capabilities to manipulate devices. CoT aims to preserve the ease-of-access and convenience of smart home devices by integrating voice-based security policies, eliminating the need for graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The proposed CoT implementation includes three main components: the voice-to-text module, authorization engine, and IoT orchestrator. Following a prototype implementation, a user study and questionnaire will assess the user-friendliness and device convenience.},
