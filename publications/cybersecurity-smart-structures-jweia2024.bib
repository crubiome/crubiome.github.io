abstract = {Controlling wind-induced responses is a challenging and fundamental step in the design of wind-sensitive critical infrastructures (CI). While passive design modifications and passive control devices are effective alternatives to a certain extent, further actions are required to fulfill design specifications under some demanding circumstances. Active countermeasures, such as active dampers, active aerodynamic devices, and operational control systems, stand out as a smart alternative that allows extra control over wind-induced responses of tall buildings, long-span bridges, wind turbines, and solar trackers. To make this possible, CI are equipped with operational technology (OT) and cyber–physical systems (CPS). However, as with any other OT/CPS, these systems can be threatened by cyberattacks. Changing their intended use could result in severe structural damage or even the eventual collapse of the structure. This study analyzes the potential consequences of cyberattacks against wind-sensitive structures equipped with OT/CPS based on case studies reported in the structural control literature. Several cyberattacks, scenarios, and possible defenses, including cyber-secure aero-structural design methods, are discussed. Furthermore, we conceptually introduce and analyze a new cyberattack, the “Wind-Leveraged False Data Injection” (WindFDI), that can be specifically developed by taking advantage of the positive feedback between wind loads and the misuse of active control systems.}
