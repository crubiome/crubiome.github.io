abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAVs), a.k.a., drones, are becoming increasingly popular, as several companies are incorporating them into highly-convenient, last-mile delivery systems. Given this market, concerns with non-consensual surveillance and destruction of drones and private property have been raised. To address these concerns, this paper presents No-Fly-Zone, a solution that proposes developing a series of physical spaces, a.k.a., zones, that utilize Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to allow users, e.g., homeowners, to define flight authorization for drones. With zones that highlight no-fly air-spaces, companies will be able to launch their drones with a lowered chance of human interference or liability, allowing for property owners to determine which level of privacy they wish to enforce. Moreover, using a map that incorporates zoning preferences, a drone path planning algorithm can safely designate a path for any commercial drone flight. No-Fly-Zone also provides a a user-friendly application for collecting and deploying zoning data to pathing algorithms with limited setbacks, thus encouraging the future integration of No-Fly-Zone with existing and future drone flight management systems.},
